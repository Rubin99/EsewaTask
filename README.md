## Dashboard:

The application consists of two tabs wit identical UI. The first tab as seen in the image below
the list fetches the data from firebase firestore database while the list on the second tab fetches
the data from firebase remote config.

Remote config is also used to change the button text, enabling a button or change the color of the layout. 
Also as mentioned before, remote config is also used to display data in the second tab.

Firebase Analytics is used to track the events of the sorting button clicks aside from its automatic and default events
